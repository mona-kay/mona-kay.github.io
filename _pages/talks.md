I led a 3 hour workshop titled _SQL for Data Science_ at ODSC East's 2020 Virtual Conference. You can find all of the materials from this session [here](https://github.com/mona-kay/odsc-sql-for-data-science).

## Effective Use of Demographic Information
*March 8, 2020*

I co-delivered a workshop at the [NYC School of Data](https://www.schoolofdata.nyc/) with my colleague Devin Johnson. We discussed many common problems associated with the use of demographic information in academia, analytics, and data science. We identify several of these problems and propose new ways of approaching the use of demographic categories.

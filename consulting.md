## Consulting Experience
I've been consulting on a variety of projects across industries for more than 5 years. Some of my consulting engagements include:

- **Machine Learning Training:** training marketing analysts in advertising/market research companies to effectively use dimensionality reduction techniques (principal component analysis, discriminant analysis) using SPSS and R
- **Analytics:** training data analysts in education to effectively analyze and communicate results from smaller data sets for consumption by non-technical audiences, including teachers and school administrators
- **Curriculum Development:** coordinating with a team of curriculum experts to design and redesign online courses in Python programming, statistics, and applied data science.

If you're looking for a data scientist and analytics expert who can support an analytics team learning new skills and software, or are looking to train a wider audience in the effective use of data, I would love to speak about how I can support your goals and commitments.

I am particularly experienced in consulting and delivering trainings on the following topics:
- Introduction to machine learning
- Choosing the right machine learning model
- Effective communication of results to non-technical audiences
- Ethical use of data science and analytic methodologies

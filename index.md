I'm Mona Khalil, Senior Manager of Analytics Engineering at Justworks. I work with teams across the company to make our data more accessible, trustworthy, and consistent. I leverage my 10 years of experience in data science & analytics to inform our strategy for data governance, self-service, and overall data maturity. I'm passionate about facilitating confident decisions in and outside of our data practice, reducing time to insight and making it possible for more of our team members to build their skills in data literacy. 

In addition, I enjoy sharing knowledge, information, and best practices with others just as was shared with me. I'm passionate about data ethics, rigorous methodologies, and data literacy. I teach, write, and mentor wherever I can.
